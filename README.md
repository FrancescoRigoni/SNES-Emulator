# SNES-Emulator
## What is this

This is an hobby project of mine, the aim is to build a full Super Nintendo emulator.
I'm working on this in my spare time, which is not much given the amount of code this thing requires.
This project is at a very initial stage right now.

## What' in already

A partial emulation of the main 65816 CPU, is already there. This CPU is an extended 16 bit version of the famous 6502 CPU.
I'm currently working on finishing the CPU emulation, this includes a lot of refactoring as well since I never wrote an emulator before
and so I figure things out along the way.

## What is still to be done ##
Lots of things have to be done after that: PPU (Picture processing unit), APU (Audio processing unit), DMA/HDMA, SuperFX chip and so on.
This will take a lot of time. But it's fun.

## Why

Why not?
There are many SNES emulator out there already, this one is not supposed to replace any of them, it's just for learning and fun.
